   ## Argumentative Errors
   Wearing uniforms in schools is very important because it eliminates the issue of students dressing inappropriately. Students often wear clothes that are too casual or even distracting, and uniforms prevent this problem. In addition, uniforms stop bullying based on appearance because everyone wears the same thing. Schools should enforce uniforms to make sure that no one stands out for the wrong reasons.
However, many students might say that uniforms limit their freedom of expression, but that doesn’t really matter. Students are in school to study, not to express themselves. Besides, there are plenty of ways to express yourself outside of clothing, so their concerns are not really important. Uniforms create a disciplined environment, and that should be the main priority. As long as students are focused on their studies, what they wear shouldn’t matter.
In conclusion, wearing uniforms is clearly the best choice because it stops people from being distracted by fashion and makes everything fair for everyone. All schools should make uniforms mandatory. Uniforms are necessary because it would make school more serious, and students would know exactly what to do every day when they wake up. In the end, students won’t be able to misbehave or be influenced by outside fashion trends, and that’s the most important thing.

  ## Argumentative Non Errors
  School uniforms should be mandatory because they promote equality and focus in the learning environment. By having all students wear the same attire, uniforms reduce the pressure to follow fashion trends or showcase expensive clothing, which can create social divides among students. This fosters a sense of unity, allowing students to concentrate on their studies rather than on their appearance or how they compare to their peers. Additionally, uniforms contribute to a more professional atmosphere, reinforcing the idea that school is a place for learning and discipline. Ultimately, uniforms help level the playing field, creating an inclusive environment where students can focus on their education without distractions related to clothing.
  
  ## Biology Errors
  There was too much glucose in the blood after consumption of breakfast, causing islets of Langerhans to be produced by the pancreas that secrete insulin. The liver then converts glucose into glycogen for storage and the blood glucose level decreases.

  ## Biology Non Errors
  Photosynthesis occurs in the presence of light.
